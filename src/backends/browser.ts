/**
 * The free backend. No key, no account, no provider.
 *
 * How it works, and why it is not what the other Ad Library scrapers do:
 *
 * The Ad Library is a React app that receives every ad from Meta as JSON over
 * GraphQL. The common approach is to let it render, flatten the DOM to markdown
 * and regex the fields back out. That round trip is lossy: it recovers one
 * creative per ad, loses the platform list, hands back an l.facebook.com
 * redirect instead of the real landing page, and breaks whenever Meta ships
 * markup.
 *
 * This backend reads the payload the page was already given. Same browser, same
 * cost, no parsing.
 *
 * Two sources, because Meta uses two. The first page of results is inlined in
 * the document as a JSON script block and no GraphQL call is made for it; every
 * page after that arrives as a GraphQL response triggered by scrolling. Reading
 * only the XHRs makes the first search depend on a scroll landing in time.
 *
 * Verified against a live capture on 2026-08-31.
